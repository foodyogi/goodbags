Yes — proceed immediately. Do not ask again.

Implement the Fix Plan with these requirements:

1) Fix DB schema defaults (critical)
File: shared/schema.ts
- Update defaults to match the current split model:
  - buybackBps default MUST be 500 (not 1500)
  - creatorBps default MUST be 2000 (not 1000)
  - charityBps default stays 7500
- Ensure the schema + migrations are aligned. If Drizzle migrations are used:
  - create a migration that ALTERs the default values for these columns in Postgres
  - do NOT change existing rows’ values automatically

2) Data safety / backward compatibility
- Do NOT modify existing launched_tokens rows (historical tokens keep their stored bps).
- Only fix the column defaults for new rows inserted without explicit BPS.

3) Remove/clean deprecated percent constant
File: shared/schema.ts (line ~258)
- If PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENTAGE = 0.25 is truly unused:
  - remove it
- If anything still imports it:
  - replace with a clearer, correct model:
    - ROYALTY_STREAM_PERCENT = 0.01  // 1%
    - DEFAULT_CHARITY_BPS = 7500
    - DEFAULT_BUYBACK_BPS = 500
    - DEFAULT_CREATOR_BPS = 2000
  - update any import references accordingly
- Goal: eliminate any misleading 0.25 constant that could reintroduce the old model.

4) Verification tests (must be run)
Create a small set of automated tests OR a script (whichever best matches current repo) that verifies end-to-end BPS math and persistence for all 5 tiers:
- 0% => 7500/500/2000
- 25% => 8000/500/1500
- 50% => 8500/500/1000
- 75% => 9000/500/500
- 100% => 9500/500/0
Tests must assert:
- sum == 10000
- bags-sdk recipients include correct wallets and omit creator if 0
- stored DB values match expected per tier

5) “Stored on-chain” truth check
- Add a short developer note in code comments (bags-sdk.ts) stating:
  “Fee share config is created in Bags and is enforced on-chain per token at launch.”
- No marketing copy edits required unless you find the claim is inaccurate.

OUTPUT REQUIRED
- Show the exact diff or code snippets for the schema default fix.
- Show the migration file name and its SQL (or the Drizzle migration content).
- Show test output / how to run it locally.
- Provide a short checklist of what you manually verified in the UI (one tier is fine if tests cover the rest).
