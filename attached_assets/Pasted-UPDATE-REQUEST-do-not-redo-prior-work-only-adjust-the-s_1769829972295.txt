UPDATE REQUEST (do not redo prior work; only adjust the split model)

We are updating the fee split plan for new tokens launched on goodbags.tech.

PREVIOUS PLAN (replace it)
- 75% charity / 15% FYI buyback / 10% creator
- optional toggle “donate creator share too” => 85/15/0

NEW PLAN (MIDDLE GROUND)
We want the built-in Bags “1% royalty stream” to be split as:

DEFAULT SPLIT (for new tokens)
- 75% charity
- 5% FYI buyback
- 20% creator

In basis points (BPS where total = 10,000):
- charity_bps = 7500
- buyback_bps = 500
- creator_bps = 2000

Add a creator donation control (replace the old simple toggle):
- “Donate some/all of my creator share to the selected charity”
- This only affects the creator portion (the 20% share).
- Buyback share stays fixed at 5% (500 BPS) always.
- Charity receives the donated portion of the creator share.

Donation control UI/behavior:
- Use presets: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% (of the creator share)
- Store donate_pct (0–1) OR donate_creator_bps (0–2000)
- Compute final BPS:
  donated_creator_bps = round(creator_bps_default * donate_pct)
  final_creator_bps = creator_bps_default - donated_creator_bps
  final_charity_bps = charity_bps_default + donated_creator_bps
  final_buyback_bps = buyback_bps_default
- Validate sum == 10,000 ALWAYS.

KEY REQUIREMENTS
- Existing tokens remain on their historical split values (backward compatible).
- New tokens use this new plan by default.
- Update the Bags fee-share recipients creation accordingly:
  - charity recipient wallet (existing verified charity wallet / X Tips method)
  - FYI buyback wallet
  - creator wallet only if final_creator_bps > 0
- Update all UI copy, receipts, dashboards, and buyback calculations to reflect:
  - buyback funding is now 5% of the 1% royalty stream (not 15% or 25%)
  - creator share is 20% before donation control

DO NOT re-implement charity verification, endorsement, or Every.org.
Only update places impacted by the split plan:
- split constants/config
- launch wizard UI/control
- DB storage for per-token split (if you already added it in prior work, reuse it)
- receipt display
- dashboards/leaderboards calculations
- buyback job budget math

OUTPUT REQUIRED
1) List the exact files/locations where you changed the split plan.
2) Confirm BPS calculations with examples:
   - donate 0% => 7500/500/2000
   - donate 50% => 8500/500/1000
   - donate 100% => 9500/500/0
3) Provide a quick QA checklist for this change.
