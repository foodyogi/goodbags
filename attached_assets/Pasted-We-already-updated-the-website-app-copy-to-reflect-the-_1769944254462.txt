We already updated the website/app copy to reflect the fee split model below. Now you must VERIFY and ENFORCE that the actual on-chain configuration and backend logic matches it.

CURRENTLY CLAIMED MODEL (must be true in code):
The fixed “1% royalty stream” is split as:
- Charity: 0.75% (7500 BPS)
- FYI Buyback: 0.05% (500 BPS)
- Creator: 0.20% (2000 BPS)

Creator donation tiers (donating % of the 0.20% creator share):
- 0% donate => charity 7500, buyback 500, creator 2000
- 25% donate => charity 8000, buyback 500, creator 1500
- 50% donate => charity 8500, buyback 500, creator 1000
- 75% donate => charity 9000, buyback 500, creator 500
- 100% donate => charity 9500, buyback 500, creator 0
Totals must ALWAYS equal 10,000 BPS.
This choice must be locked at launch (i.e., encoded into the Bags fee-share config used for the token).

MANDATORY STEP 1 — AUDIT THE IMPLEMENTATION
Before changing anything, find and report (with exact file paths and code references):
1) Where the Bags recipients / fee-share config is constructed for token launch.
2) Where the donation tier (0/25/50/75/100) is captured in the launch UI and passed to backend.
3) Where per-token split values are stored in DB (launched_tokens or equivalent).
4) Where token detail pages and dashboards read and display the split.
5) Where the FYI buyback job computes its budget/assumptions and whether it still assumes 0.25% or 0.15% anywhere.
6) Any place that still uses hard-coded values inconsistent with 7500/500/2000.

MANDATORY STEP 2 — MAKE THE CLAIM TRUE (CODE CHANGES)
Implement or fix the following so the system matches the model:

A) Token Launch (On-chain config via Bags)
- Ensure the actual Bags fee-share recipients are created with the exact BPS computed from the selected donation tier.
- Recipients must include:
  1) Charity recipient: existing payout method logic (direct Solana wallet OR X claim) — do not break it.
  2) FYI buyback wallet: use existing env/config wallet.
  3) Creator wallet: connected wallet only if creator_bps > 0.
- Validate sum==10000 BPS and fail the launch with a clear error if not.

B) Persist per-token split
- Store per-token: charity_bps, buyback_bps, creator_bps, donate_tier (0/25/50/75/100) or donate_pct.
- If DB columns don’t exist, add a Drizzle migration.
- For existing tokens launched under older split rules, preserve their historical values and display correctly (backward compatible).
- All UI displays must read from per-token stored values, not global constants.

C) Dashboards + stats
- Donation totals count ONLY charity_bps portion.
- Buyback displays and any “expected buyback” calculations must reflect buyback_bps = 500 for new tokens.
- If the buyback engine uses actual wallet inflows, ensure dashboard labels don’t misrepresent the source; keep consistent with the 0.05% share and show actual buys from the buyback wallet.

D) Truthfulness of “stored on-chain”
- Confirm whether the donation tier/split is truly stored in the on-chain fee-share config used by Bags.
- If YES: keep copy as-is.
- If NO: update the in-app copy to be precise (e.g., “configured at launch and enforced on-chain” vs “stored on-chain”) — but only if necessary.

OUTPUT REQUIRED
1) An “Audit Report” with file paths + what you found.
2) A “Fix Plan” with exact files to change.
3) Implement the fixes.
4) Provide 5 test cases demonstrating that each tier produces the correct BPS in the Bags config and is stored/displayed correctly.
5) Confirm buyback job and dashboards now align with 0.05% buyback share.
