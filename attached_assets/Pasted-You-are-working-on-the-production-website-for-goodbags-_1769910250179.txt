You are working on the production website for goodbags.tech (a Solana token launch platform with built-in charitable giving).
Goal: Update website copy + sections to reflect Bags’ new AI Agent onboarding / fee sharing capability, and position GoodBags as the easiest way to launch “purpose-driven coins” with verifiable, on-chain impact — using the actual fee-splitting logic currently implemented in the app.

⸻

HIGH-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

1) Update messaging across homepage and key pages to emphasize:
	•	“Purpose-Driven Coins” (tagline under logo)
	•	Built-in giving with exact fee logic: 1% total platform fee on every trade
	•	Transparent, on-chain, automatic distribution
	•	Agent-friendly: creators can use AI Agents to launch coins and claim fees (where applicable), while impact settings are stored at launch and enforced on-chain

2) Add a new homepage section titled:

“AI Agents Ready”

Include 3 bullets:
	•	Launch coins for anyone (agent-assisted)
	•	Claim fees (agent-assisted)
	•	Trade / market-make (agent-assisted)

Add a short disclaimer line:
“GoodBags does not custody funds. Wallet permissions are controlled by the user.”

⸻

FEE SPLITTING LOGIC (MUST MATCH EXACTLY)

Total Platform Fee: 1% of all trades

This 1% fee is split three ways by default:
	•	Charity: 0.75%
Goes directly to the verified charity chosen at token launch
	•	FYI Buyback: 0.05%
Used to buy back FYI tokens, supporting the ecosystem
	•	Token Creator: 0.20%
Creator’s share for launching the token

Creator Donation Option (at launch)

Creators can choose to donate 0–100% of their 0.20% share back to the charity.

Show this exact table (or a mobile-friendly equivalent):
	•	0% donation → Charity 0.75%, Buyback 0.05%, Creator 0.20%
	•	25% donation → Charity 0.80%, Buyback 0.05%, Creator 0.15%
	•	50% donation → Charity 0.85%, Buyback 0.05%, Creator 0.10%
	•	75% donation → Charity 0.90%, Buyback 0.05%, Creator 0.05%
	•	100% donation → Charity 0.95%, Buyback 0.05%, Creator 0.00%

⸻

3) Add a new page (or section) called “How It Works” with clear steps:

Keep it simple, readable, and non-technical, but accurate.

Step 1: Choose a verified charity (at launch)
Step 2: Choose your creator donation % (0–100% of the 0.20% creator share)
Step 3: Launch on Solana (via Bags)
Step 4: Trading happens → the 1% fee is automatically distributed using the stored split
Step 5: Track proof / transparency (link to token dashboard / on-chain records placeholder)

Include a small “Payout options” subsection:
	•	Direct wallet: sent to the charity’s verified Solana address
	•	X/Twitter claim: held until the charity verifies via their X account

Include the example box (use these exact numbers):
Example: If someone trades 100 SOL and the creator donates 75%, then:
	•	Total fee: 1 SOL
	•	Charity receives: 0.90 SOL
	•	FYI Buyback: 0.05 SOL
	•	Creator receives: 0.05 SOL

⸻

4) Add a “Trust & Transparency” block (homepage + How It Works) with:
	•	On-chain verifiable
	•	No custody
	•	Fee settings stored at launch
	•	Built to reduce scams/spam
Add a small “Learn more” link to How It Works

⸻

5) Update CTA buttons:
	•	Primary: “Launch a Purpose-Driven Coin”
	•	Secondary: “See How It Works”
Add a small text link near CTAs: “Powered by Bags”

⸻

6) Add a small footer line (or FAQ):

“GoodBags is a launch experience and impact layer built on top of Bags. Bags provides the token launch and fee infrastructure.”

⸻

CONTENT/STYLE GUIDELINES
	•	Tone: confident, modern, simple, impact-forward.
	•	Avoid overpromising. Don’t say “guaranteed donations” unless it’s enforced; prefer:
	•	“routes automatically”
	•	“stored on-chain”
	•	“verifiable”
	•	Keep sections short and scannable.

⸻

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
	•	Do not break current layout.
	•	Reuse existing components/styles where possible.
	•	Ensure mobile responsiveness (tables must collapse nicely).
	•	If there is an existing FAQ, add these Qs:
	1.	“What is the fee split?” → Explain the 1% total fee and default split, plus creator donation option.
	2.	“Can AI Agents launch coins?” → “Yes. Bags supports agentic authentication flows; GoodBags works with agent-assisted launches.”
	3.	“Do you custody funds?” → “No. Users control wallets and permissions.”

⸻

DELIVERABLE
	•	Make the changes directly in the codebase.
	•	Provide a summary of modified files and what changed.
	•	If you add a new page/route, include the route path and link it in navigation or footer.
